    ******************* ABSTRACT OPERATIONS *****************
    
    > There are some set of algorithms that is present in the ecmascript documentation but they are not available
      for usage in ecmascript/javascript i.e. we as developer cannot use these operations directly.

    > They are mentioned in the docs to aid the documentation only.
        In the ecma docs there are a lot of things that are done by the language internally.
        To explain these internals details of  how and what language is doing, we have abstract operations mentioned in the docs.

    > various Abstract operations.
      1. ToNumber
      2. ToPrimitive
      3. ToBoolean
      4. ToString
